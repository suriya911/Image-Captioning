# Image Captioning Project

This project aims to generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a combination of computer vision and natural language processing to automatically generate captions that describe the content of an image.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: The project includes code for preprocessing the input images, such as resizing, normalization, and feature extraction using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like VGG16 or ResNet.
- **Caption Generation**: The project implements a deep learning model, such as an LSTM-based neural network, to generate captions for the preprocessed images. The model is trained on a large dataset of image-caption pairs.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The project includes code for evaluating the quality of the generated captions using metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr. These metrics help assess the similarity between the generated captions and the ground truth captions.
- **Demo Notebook**: A Jupyter notebook is provided that demonstrates the entire image captioning pipeline, from image preprocessing to caption generation. It includes example code and explanations for each step.
